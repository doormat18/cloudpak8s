# IBM Cloud Pak Playbook

IBM Cloud™ Paks are enterprise-ready, containerized software solutions that give clients an open, fast and secure way to move core business applications to any cloud. Each IBM Cloud Pak™ runs on Red Hat® OpenShift® on IBM Cloud, other public clouds, or on-premises. IBM Cloud Paks include containerized IBM middleware and common software services for development and management.

The IBM Cloud Pak Playbook covers the following IBM Cloud Paks, running on Red Hat OpenShift 4.2:

- Cloud Pak for Applications
- Cloud Pak for Automation
- Cloud Pak for Integration
- Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management

This playbook is designed to complement the official documentation, 
adding best practices, scenario implementation guidance, and more 
detailed technical information where needed. The official 
[IBM Cloud Pak documentation](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter) 
should always be used as your first source of knowledge.

The playbook is a living document following the principles of open source. It is presented AS IS to describe experiences working in specific environments.
