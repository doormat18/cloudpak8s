## **Introduction**

The Netcool Ops Manager has been designed and installed; initial configuration had been performed. 
What is next? The application now needs to be further configured to provide value to the user. 
The Agile Service Manager's Observer now need to be configured to start importing the topology from the manages system, for example.
These further configurations after the initial configuration are referred to as day2 activities. 
It is _business as usual_ for the application. It might also involve troubleshooting application issues.
