## **Introduction**

The Netcool Ops Manager has been designed and installed; initial configuration had been performed. 
What is next? The application now needs to be further configured to provide value to the user. 
The Agile Service Manager's Observer now needs to be configured to start importing the topology from the manages system, for example.
These further configurations after the initial configuration are referred to as day2 activities. 
It is _business as usual_ for the application. It might also involve troubleshooting application issues.

## Articles and Blogs on ASM day-2

- [ ] [Finding your weak spots with IBM Agile Service Manager](https://medium.com/@ibmmattdugg/finding-your-weak-spots-with-ibm-agile-service-manager-3d4c5c6d0e55).
This blog describes how to configure ASM to display a topology's **single-point-of-failure**.  A single-point-of-failure, if removed, will cause the topology to split into two or more disconnected components.

- [ ] [Using Merge Rules in Agile Service Manager](https://medium.com/@ibmjdiaz/using-merge-rules-in-agile-service-manager-b66b36707b1c).
ASM can merge or combine the topology from different observers.  This blog explains and provides examples of how you can perform a **merge** in ASM.

- [ ] [Topology Modeling using Agile Service Manager: A tutorial](https://medium.com/ibm-garage/topology-modelling-using-agile-service-manager-a-tutorial-2e521040ea64).
This blog is a tutorial on building a topology model using the Agile Service Manager using a text file.

- [ ] [Building a topology using Agile Service Manager's REST Interface](https://medium.com/ibm-garage/topology-modelling-using-agile-service-managers-rest-interface-7de14a85e333).
This blog continues the ASM tutorial by showing how you can build a topology by programmatically interacting with the ASM's REST Interface.
