## **Installing Cloud Pak for Applications Then Cloud Pak for Integration**

This section describes the scenario of installing Cloud Pak 
for Applications first, followed by Cloud Pak for Integration. 

From the experience of the residency group, if you are wanting to 
install these two Cloud Paks in this order in the same cluster, it is important
to follow the instructions below to resolve conflicts and make things
go smoothly

The first step is to consider the prerequisites for the Cloud Paks you
want to install and to make sure your cluster has the required resources.

### **Cloud Pak for Applications Prerequisites**
* Refer to the Knowledge Center 
[prerequisites page](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSCSJL_4.x/install-prerequisites.html) 
(Cloud Pak for Applications 4.0.x) 
for details on what is required before starting an installation.
* Also consider the prerequisites for installing the Cloud Pak for Applications
developer tools. Prerequisites and installation instructions are provided in
this Playbook for [Mac](/apps/cp4a_install_dev_tools_mac/) and for
[Windows](/apps/cp4a_install_dev_tools_win/) workstations.

### **Cloud Pak for Integration Prerequisites**
* Refer to the Knowledge Center 
[prerequisites page](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGT7J_19.4/install/sysreqs.html) 
(Cloud Pak for Integration 2019.4)
for details on what is required before starting an installation.

### **Cloud Pak for Integration + Applications** 
### **Combined Minimum Requirements (January 2020):**

For your convenenience, the combined resource requirements that were used
during the residency in January 2020 are shown below. You are advised to 
check the product documentation for the most current numbers for the 
releases you want to install.

| Node Type | Quantity | CPU | RAM | DISK 1 |DISK 2 | DISK 3 |
| :---------- | :------: | :-------: | :---: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
| Bootstrap | 1 | 4 | 16 | 100 | | |
| Installer | 1 | 4 | 16 | 120 | | |
| LB | 1 | 4 | 16 |120 | | |
| Master | 3 | 16 | 32 | 300 | | |
| Compute | 8 | 16 | 64 | 200|  |  |
| Storage | 3 | 4 | 16 | 200 | 500 |  |
| NFS | 1 | 2 | 8 | 500 |  |  |

## **Installation Instructions**

### 1. **Installing Cloud Pak for Applications**

The Cloud Pak for Applications can be installed following the instructions
in the 
[Knowledge Center](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSCSJL_4.0.x/install-icpa.html) 
or in the [Cloud Pak for Applications](/apps/cp4a_overview)
section of this Playbook.

### 2. **Before Installing Cloud Pak for Integration:**

The instructions to install Cloud Pak for Integration are further 
down the page. Before you do that installation, read the following
paragraphs to understand that your first installation attempt will
fail. The following paragraphs describe the problem and the solution
for you to complete your installation of Cloud Pak for Integration
successfully.

#### **Conflict with Installed Helm Component Issue:**Â 

The `Helm` component is installed and used by Cloud Pak for Application. 
The installation of Cloud Pak for Integration also includes the `Helm`
component. At the time of writing, there was no built-in function in the 
installer to deal with an already existing `Helm`.

When the Cloud Pak for Integration is trying to install `Helm` on the same
cluster, and finds an existing Custom Resource Definition (CRD) with  
a certificate for `Helm`, the installation fails. Cloud Pak for Applications
and Cloud Pak for Integration share the same certificate, and the 
Cloud Pak for Integration installer cannot tolerate the condition where
the certificate already exists.

Trying to complete an installation after a failed partial install will 
result in failure of the IBM Cloud Pak (ICP) common services creation in
in the `kube-system` namespace, due to missing secrets.

#### **Solution:**

The solution is to do a full uninstall of Cloud Pak for Integration after
after your initial installation fails, and then to reinstall it. 
The uninstaller removes the common component and allows the reinstall to 
run without encountering the conflict.

It is possible that the uninstall might hang. You can check for and 
clear that condition by checking for pods in a terminating state and 
doing a force delete on them. Use the following command to see if you
have pods stuck in a terminating state.

```
oc get pods --all-namespaces | grep Terminating
```

If you do find pods in that condition, use the following command on each
such pod to do a force deletion.

```
oc delete pod <pod name> -n <project-name> --force --grace-period=0 
```

### 3. **Installing Cloud Pak for Integration**

The Cloud Pak for Integration can be installed following the instructions
in the 
[Knowledge Center](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGT7J_19.4/install/install.html) 
or in the [Cloud Pak for Integration](/integration/introduction)
section of this Playbook.
