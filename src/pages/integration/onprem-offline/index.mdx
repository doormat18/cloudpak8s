**NOTE: Make sure you have 200GB or more on your installer node. If you have less, then you can download the offline image, extract and delete the original file**

## Setting the max_map_count

SSH into all your worker and storage nodes and set the max_map_count to 262144.

```bash
sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
echo "vm.max_map_count=262144" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
```

## Download and extract the image

SSH into your installer node. Go to `/opt` dir and download the image there. To download the image from IBM XL, use this <https://w3-03.ibm.com/software/xl/download/ticket.wss>. If in the csplab environment, CP4I 2019.4.1 is already downloaded on the csplab jump server, we'll `wget` from there as it's much faster.

```bash
cd /opt
wget http://storage4.csplab.local/storage/cp4i/ibm-cp-int-2019.4.1-offline.tar.gz
mkdir cp4ioffline
tar xf ibm-cp-int-2019.4.1-offline.tar.gz --directory /opt/cp4ioffline
cd cp4ioffline
tar xvf installer_files/cluster/images/common-services-armonk-x86_64.tar.gz -O | sudo docker load
```

you can delete `ibm-cp-int-2019.4.1-offline.tar.gz` now if you're low on space.

## Creating config.yaml

Find your oauth route. Run the following command to find it.

```bash
$ oc get routes --all-namespaces | grep oauth
openshift-authentication   oauth-openshift     oauth-openshift.apps.mislam.ocp.csplab.local
```

Get the config.yaml from here: https://github.ibm.com/cpat/cp4-integration/blob/master/infra/helper-scripts/config.yaml

Create a backup of the default `config.yaml` inside of `/opt/cp4ioffline/installer_files/cluster` and paste in your oauth route in the following part of your `config.yaml`:

```yaml
roks_enabled: true
roks_url: https://oauth-openshift.apps.mnb.ocp.csplab.local -> your oauth route
roks_user_prefix: ""
```

## Creating getAllRec.sh

When the installer fails, this script will echo all the pods that are up and running and pods that are failing.

```bash
cd /opt
touch getAllRec.sh
sudo chmod 755 getAllRec.sh
./getAllRec.sh kube-system
```

Get the getAllRec.sh file from here: https://github.ibm.com/cpat/cp4-integration/blob/master/infra/helper-scripts/getAllRec.sh

## Creating the correct kubeconfig

First we have to copy our kubeconfig to the cluster directory. 

```bash
cd /opt/cp4ioffline/installer_files/cluster
oc config view > kubeconfig
```

Now `cat` your kubeconfig file and see if it has `insecure-skip-tls-verify: true`config. The cluster part should look something like this.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    insecure-skip-tls-verify: true
    server: https://api.mislam.ocp.csplab.local:6443
  name: api-mislam-ocp-csplab-local:6443
```

But if you see this, you have to replace `certificate-authority-data: DATA+OMITTED` with `insecure-skip-tls-verify: true`

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    certificate-authority-data: DATA+OMITTED
    server: https://api.mislam.ocp.csplab.local:6443
```

Alternatively we can copy it from our Openshift Cluster Auth directory to here. 

```bash
cp /opt/myocpcluster/auth/kubeconfig /opt/cp4ioffline/installer_files/cluster
```

## Starting the install process

Now we run the installer. Notice it's a nohup job (runs on the background) and the logs are written to `install.log` so you can close your terminal and leave but the installer will keep on going on the server. And log back in and look at `install.log` to see progress.

```bash
nohup sudo docker run -t --net=host -e LICENSE=accept -v $(pwd):/installer/cluster:z -v /var/run:/var/run:z -v /etc/docker:/etc/docker:z --security-opt label:disable ibmcom/icp-inception-amd64:3.2.2 addon -vvv | tee install.log &
```

**NOTE: If the installer fails, run the getAllRec.sh script to check if common services is up or not. If it isn't up, you can run the installer again. If it is up but one of the capabilities failed tyo get pushed, then that capability can be applied individually** 
## Uninstalling Common Services

In case the installer fails on the same step multiple times, it's better to uninstall and try again. To uninstall

```bash
nohup sudo docker run -t --net=host -e LICENSE=accept -v $(pwd):/installer/cluster:z -v /var/run:/var/run:z -v /etc/docker:/etc/docker:z --security-opt label:disable ibmcom/icp-inception-amd64:3.2.2 uninstall-with-openshift | tee install.log &
```
