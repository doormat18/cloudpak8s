### Command-line Tools

The following table details the command-line interface (CLI) tools and 
versions that are required for IBM Cloud Pak for Data.

You can copy and paste commands to download each of the CLI tools for 
any of the supported operating systems from the IBM Cloud Private 
management console. For more information, see the Knowledge Center 
[IBM Cloud Private CLI tools guide](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSBS6K_3.2.1/manage_cluster/cli_guide.html?view=kc).

### **Note:**

**IBM Cloud Private** is the name of a former IBM product that has been withdrawn
from marketing. It was referred to by the acronym **ICP**. While the product has
been withdrawn, some of its product components are still being used for the
Common Services layer used by this and other IBM Cloud Paks. The ICP acronym
is being re-purposed to mean **IBM Cloud Platform**. However in some of the 
documentation links and in some of the product components, you will sometimes
see the name IBM Cloud Private still being used. For the purposes of the 
instructions in this Playbook, the terms **IBM Cloud Private** and 
**IBM Cloud Platform Common Services** can be understood as synonymous.
