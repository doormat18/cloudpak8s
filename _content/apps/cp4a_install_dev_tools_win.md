## Prerequisites

Before beginning these steps you should have:
1. A github account (or Github Enterprise)
1. A Dockerhub account (needed to install docker)
1. A Red Hat entitled customer account (to install oc)
1. An IDE (Eclipse or VS Code to use with Codewind)
1. A login for your Openshift Container cluster


## Installing Client tools from web pages on the cluster

As part of installing the OC cluster and the Cloud Pak for Applications two web pages will be created. It is recommended that you use these pages to get the most current installation information about the client tools. This document will also provide links to these tools on the web.

When the OpenShift cluster is created, a reference page is generated for the OpenShift command line tools. There are several useful links on this page. Get this URL from your administrator.

%}

**Note:** You will need to authenticate (login) to your cluster.

When the Cloud Pak for Applications is installed, a "landing page" is created for Kabanero. Your administrator can give you this URL.

 alt="Command Line Tools"
%}

**Note:** You will need to authenticate (login) to your cluster.
