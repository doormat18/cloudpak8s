# IAM settings for OpenShift on VMware
After you build your OCP cluster on VMware, by defauilt, the user **kubeadmin** exists on your cluster.  That is the only user and you can use it for temporary. When you login the OCP dashboard, you will see the warning message as shown in below.

On OpenShift on VMWare, several Identity Providers are supported such as **Basic Authentication**, **LDAP**, **OpenID**, **HTPasswd**, and others. To specify an identity provider, you must create a Custom Resource (CR) that describes that identity provider and add it to the cluster.  


The identity provider for OpenShift that is simplest to use is the HTPasswd identity provider, which uses user passwords stored in the cluster etcd storage as a secret. In this document, we will demonstrate how to add users with HTPasswd identity provider.　　


## Configuring an HTPasswd identity provider
To define an HTPasswd identity provider you must perform the following steps:
1. Create an htpasswd file to store the user and password information. Instructions are provided for [MacOS](#create-an-htpassword-file-on-macos) and [Linux](#create-an-htpassword-file-on-linux).
2. Create an OpenShift Container Platform secret to represent the htpasswd file.
3. Define the HTPasswd identity provider resource.
4. Apply the resource to the default OAuth configuration.  


## Create an htpasswd file
To use the HTPasswd identity provider, you must generate a flat file that contains the user names and passwords for your cluster by using htpasswd.  

### Prerequisites
Have access to the htpasswd utility. On Red Hat Enterprise Linux this is available by installing the httpd-tools package.  

### Procedure
1. Create or update your flat file with a user name and hashed password:
```
$ htpasswd -c -B -b </path/to/users.htpasswd> <user_name> <password> 
The command generates a hashed version of the password.
```
2. Continue to add or update credentials to the file:
```
$ htpasswd -b </path/to/users.htpasswd> <user_name> <password>   
```
NOTE: if updating an old file, drop the -c

<a name="create-an-htpassword-file-on-macos"></a>

### Create an htpasswd file on MacOS

For example, we created an htpasswd file on Mac as follow.  

```
$ htpasswd -c -B -b users.htpasswd kenueno MyPassword!
Adding password for user kenueno
$ 
$ htpasswd -b users.htpasswd rstoner MyPassword!
Adding password for user rstoner
$ 
```
<a name="create-an-htpassword-file-on-linux"></a>

### Create an htpasswd file on Linux
Here is an example to create an htpasswd filed on Linux.

```
$ touch htpasswd
$ 
$ htpasswd -Bb htpasswd alice 'p4ssw0rd'
Adding password for user alice
$ 
$ htpasswd -Bb htpasswd bob 'p4ssw0rd'
Adding password for user bob
$ 
$ htpasswd -Bb htpasswd claire 'p4ssw0rd'
Adding password for user claire
$ 
```

Note that if you don't have the htpasswd command on your linux (CentOS, in our case), here is how you install it.
```

## Creating the HTPasswd Secret
To use the HTPasswd identity provider, you must define a secret that contains the HTPasswd user file.  

### Prerequisites
Create an HTPasswd file.  

### Procedure
Create an OpenShift Container Platform Secret that contains the HTPasswd users file.
```
$ oc create secret generic htpass-secret --from-file=htpasswd=</path/to/users.htpasswd> -n openshift-config
```

In the previous example, we created a file called htpasswd.  We will create a scecret from that file as follow.  
```
$ oc create secret generic htpasswd --from-file=htpasswd -n openshift-config
secret/htpasswd created
$
```

NOTE:
Create the manifest for the cluster secret. This is used by the authentication provider to read the individual credentials.
This as a dry run to create a file for the manifest because the secret should exist already. 
```
oc create secret generic htpasswd-secret --from-file=htpasswd=./openshift.htpasswd  --namespace openshift-config --dry-run  --output yaml > ./htpass-secret.yaml  
```
Replace the existing secret, this could be done as a pipe from the previous command.
```
oc replace --filename ./htpass-secret.yaml  
```


Then, create a yaml file for the Custom Resource (CR) as follow.
``` 
$ vi oauth-config.yaml
$ cat oauth-config.yaml 
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: OAuth
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  identityProviders:
  - name: Local Password
    mappingMethod: claim
    type: HTPasswd
    htpasswd:
      fileData:
        name: htpasswd
$ 
```
### Sample HTPasswd CR
The following Custom Resource (CR) shows the parameters and acceptable values for an HTPasswd identity provider. 
![htpasswd_yaml](/assets/img/day2/htpasswd_yaml.png)


## Apply the custom resource of identity provider to the default OAuth configuration
Add an identity provider so your users can authenticate.  

### Prerequisites
Create an OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
Create the Custom Resource (CR) for your identity providers.
You must be logged in as an administrator.  

### Procedure
1. Apply the defined CR:  
```
$ oc apply -f </path/to/CR>  
```
or we can use oc replace as follow.
```
$ oc replace -f oauth-config.yaml
oauth.config.openshift.io/cluster replaced
```

Note: If a CR does not exist, oc apply creates a new CR and might trigger the following warning:  
```
Warning: oc apply should be used on resources created by either oc create --save-config or oc apply
```

In this case you can safely ignore this warning.  

2. Log in to the cluster as a user from your identity provider, entering the password when prompted.
```
$ oc login -u <username>  
```

3. Confirm that the user logged in successfully, and display the user name.  
```
$ oc whoami  
```






## Configuring identity providers using the web console 
Configure your identity provider (IDP) through the web console instead of the CLI.  

### Prerequisites
You must be logged in to the web console as a cluster administrator.  

### Procedure
1. Navigate to Administration → Cluster Settings.
2. Under the Global Configuration tab, click OAuth.  

![htpasswd1](/assets/img/day2/htpasswd_GUI_1.png)

3. Under the Identity Providers section, select your identity provider from the Add drop-down menu. 

![htpasswd2](/assets/img/day2/htpasswd_GUI_2.png)  

![htpasswd3](/assets/img/day2/htpasswd_GUI_3.png)  

![htpasswd4](/assets/img/day2/htpasswd_GUI_4.png)  


Note: You can specify multiple IDPs through the web console without overwriting existing IDPs.

Before adding the HTPasswd, the yml file was something like this.
```
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: OAuth
metadata:
  annotations:
    release.openshift.io/create-only: 'true'
  creationTimestamp: '2019-11-21T04:10:10Z'
  generation: 1
  name: cluster
  resourceVersion: '1755'
  selfLink: /apis/config.openshift.io/v1/oauths/cluster
  uid: cf3d67c0-0c14-11ea-bbad-005056a57cfd
spec: {}
```  

After the HTPasswd was added, the yml file was updated as follow.
```
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: OAuth
metadata:
  annotations:
    release.openshift.io/create-only: 'true'
  creationTimestamp: '2019-11-21T04:10:10Z'
  generation: 2
  name: cluster
  resourceVersion: '3123929'
  selfLink: /apis/config.openshift.io/v1/oauths/cluster
  uid: cf3d67c0-0c14-11ea-bbad-005056a57cfd
spec:
  identityProviders:
    - htpasswd:
        fileData:
          name: htpasswd-h89hn
      mappingMethod: claim
      name: htpasswd
      type: HTPasswd
```  
  
  
We would like to mention one more thing.  
Here is the scenario.  We create 3 users such as "alice", "bob", and "clair" with htpasswd as follow.
```
$ htpasswd -Bb htpasswd alice 'p4ssw0rd'
Adding password for user alice
$ htpasswd -Bb htpasswd bob 'p4ssw0rd'
Adding password for user bob
$ htpasswd -Bb htpasswd claire 'p4ssw0rd'
Adding password for user claire
$ oc --user=admin create secret generic htpasswd --from-file=htpasswd -n openshift-config
secret/htpasswd created
$ vi oauth-config.yaml
$ cat oauth-config.yaml 
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: OAuth
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  identityProviders:
  - name: Local Password
    mappingMethod: claim
    type: HTPasswd
    htpasswd:
      fileData:
        name: htpasswd
$ oc --user=admin replace -f oauth-config.yaml
oauth.config.openshift.io/cluster replaced
$ 
```
Now, we have 3 users created and will use the htpasswd for the authentication. Both **alice** and **bob** logged in the cluster successfully with their password.  However, the user **claire** has not logged in the cluster yet.
At this moment, here is what you see with oc commands.

```
$ oc --user=admin get users
NAME     UID                                    FULL NAME        IDENTITIES
alice    962fdf1e-1848-11ea-a3e1-0a580a80011d                    Local Password:alice
bob      d0d4f046-1845-11ea-a3e1-0a580a80011d                    Local Password:bob

$
$ oc --user=admin get identities
NAME                                                                                                          IDP NAME         IDP USER NAME                                                                                    USER NAME   USER UID
Local Password:alice                                                                                          Local Password   alice                                                                                            alice       962fdf1e-1848-11ea-a3e1-0a580a80011d
Local Password:bob                                                                                            Local Password   bob                                                                                              bob         d0d4f046-1845-11ea-a3e1-0a580a80011d
$ 
```
No user or identity for **claire** appears because user objects are created on first login.  


## Disable kubeadmin Account
Since you will not need the kubeadmin account to be active in you OpenShift cluster any more, you would disable the kubeadmin account by removing the password secret.  
Here are the steps to disable the **kubeadmin** account.  

### Set up cluster admin access to your user ID.
Before you disable the kubeadmin account, you need to set up the cluster admin access to your user.  
Copy the kubeconfig created by the OpenShift installation to your user’s ~/.kube/config location.
```
$ cp -p <OCP_installation_dir>/auth/kubeconfig <your_user_$HOME>/.kube/config
```
Login with your user and run oc whoami command as follow.  In our case, our user is **bob**.
```
$ oc login -u bob -p p4ssw0rd
Login successful.

You don't have any projects. You can try to create a new project, by running

    oc new-project <projectname>

$ 
$ oc whoami
bob
$ 
```
Then, you will run the oc command with **--user=admin** option to confirm that your kubeconfig admin user corresponds to the system:admin cluster account as follow.
```
$ oc --user=admin whoami
system:admin
$ 
```  

Now, you have an access as the system:admin account using the kubeconfig installer file.

### Delete the kubeadmin secret from the kube-system namespace.
Here is the command output in our environment.
```
$ oc --user=admin delete secret kubeadmin -n kube-system
secret "kubeadmin" deleted
```
### Confirm that the kubeadmin user is no longer accessible.
You need to have the password of **kubeadmin** user to login via cli.  You can find it in the kubeadmin-password file under the <installation_dir>/auth directory.  
```
cat <installation_dir>/auth/kubeadmin-password
```  

You can get the API URL with oc command as follow.
```
$oc whoami --show-server
```
Then, you run oc login command with the **kubeadmin** user.  
Here is the command output in our environment.
```
$ oc login -u kubeadmin -p "$KUBEADMIN_PASSWORD" "$API_URL"
Login failed (401 Unauthorized)
Verify you have provided correct credentials.
```
### Confirm that system:admin account is still available with the TLS authentication.
Run oc command with **--user=admin** to confirm that the system:admin account is still available as follow.

```
$ oc --user=admin whoami
system:admin
$ 
```  




## Maintain (Add/Remove) Users as Day 2 operation
At the moment, you complete the user onboarding task with an HTPasswd identity provider.  As Day 2 operation, you may need to maintain users in your cluster, for example, you would periodically add/remove users due to the organization changes, job assigment changes, leave company, etc.  You probably would like to do such task as a batch job and run it once a day at night, for example.  We will show you how to do it.
