## Multiple Cloud Pak Installation

This section describes the findings of a group, participating in a residency 
project in January 2020, to install more than one IBM Cloud Pak in the same
cluster. During the limited time duration of the residency, the group 
was able to test two combinations, as follows:

1. [Installing Cloud Pak for Integration first Cloud Pak for
Applications second](../cp4i-cp4a/)
2. [Installing Cloud Pak for Applications first Cloud Pak for
Integration second](../cp4a-cp4i/)

Each chapter in this section links to the steps to install each of the 
respective Cloud Paks in the test. Generally, there is no change to the
standard Cloud Pak installation instructions for these multiple Cloud Pak
scenarios.

However, there are some configuration steps recommended to avoid potential 
conflicts where both Cloud Paks include the same component. 
Each chapter describes those special steps to take, based on the group's
experience, to avoid problems. It is important to note that these
descriptions reflect the state of the Cloud Paks in January 2020. In all
cases, it is recommended to follow the official product Documentation
in the [Knowledge Center](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter) as
your authoritive source of knowledge.

The links below direct you to the other sections of this Playbook 
describing the 
installation and configuration of the IBM Cloud Paks tested in
this project.
