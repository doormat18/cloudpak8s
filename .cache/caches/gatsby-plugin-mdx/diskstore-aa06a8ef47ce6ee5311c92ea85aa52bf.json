You’ll see performance and topology information about the cluster, namespaces, nodes, pods, containers, and more.  `}</p>\n    <img {...{\n      \"src\": \"/assets/img/cp4mcm/node.png\",\n      \"alt\": \"Kubernetes Node toplogy and utilization\"\n    }}></img>\n    <p>{`For detailed steps on setting up the Kubernetes Data Collector, go to the section labeled `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"#setting-up-the-kubernetes-data-collector\"\n      }}>{`Setting up the Kubernetes Data Collector`}</a></p>\n    <h3>{`2.  Setup Synthetic Monitoring`}</h3>\n    <p>{`The next recommendation is to setup synthetic monitoring.  We recommend it for two reasons.  First, it is easy and you can get value very quickly.  Second, it is a powerful way to ensure your applications and microservices are up and running within the expected response times.   There are two types of synthetics provided by ICAM.  You can test your webpages.  We use Selenium to test a single webpage or to exercise a web based application.  By recording a script with the selenium IDE, you can exercise a sequence of steps through the browser and simulate real interactions with the application.  In addition, you can proactively test your REST APIs either with single REST requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) or via a scripted sequence of API calls.   You begin by setting up a synthetic PoP (Point of Presence) Agent.  The Agent is installed on any machine running Docker and most customers install two or more PoP servers so that they can compare the performance from different locations.   `}</p>\n    <img {...{\n      \"src\": \"/assets/img/cp4mcm/synthetics.png\",\n      \"alt\": \"Synthetic Monitoring\"\n    }}></img>\n    <p>{`See the section titled `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"#setting-up-synthetics\"\n      }}>{`Setting up Synthetics`}</a>{` for detailed instructions.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`3.  Instrument other cloud native resources`}</h3>\n    <p>{`The next step is to begin instrumenting the workloads that are running within the kubernetes environment.  Ideally, you want to gain visibility into the application and how it is performing as well as assess the transactional flows within the application.   By instrumenting the application runtime with the lightweight Data Collectors, we give visibility into the Golden Signals to help you understand and analyze the performance characteristics.   The runtime Data Collector collectors can also provide visibility into the topology and transactional flows within the microservices.  In additional, once you start getting visibility into the topologies, you can start to analyze that topolgy for change and understand how change might be affecting your application or service.`}</p>\n    <img {...{\n      \"src\": \"/assets/img/cp4mcm/golden_signals.png\",\n      \"alt\": \"Golden Signals and Microservice Topology\"\n    }}></img>\n    <p>{`There are a few different Data Collectors for instrumenting node.js, Liberty, Springboot, Go, and more.   In addition to the topology data and Golden Signals, these data collectors allow you to drill down into detailed performance KPIs related to the app server performance characteristics.  If you want additional information on instrumenting the application runtimes, see the `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"#lightweight-data-collectors\"\n      }}>{`Lightweight Data Collectors`}</a>{` section below`}</p>\n    <p>{`If it is not possible to get access to the DevOps pipeline to instrument the runtimes, there are other ways to get visibility into the topology and transactional flows.  Some customers instrument their applications with zipkin or jaeger.  If zipkin or jaeger are in place, then you can deploy the Unified Agent plugin for zipkin/jaeger and it will begin to track the transactions.  You won’t the deep App Server metric KPIs, but you will get very detailed information about the transactions.    For customers that have setup istio for their application, the istio service mesh provides a wealth of data related to the topology and transactional flows.  The Unified Agent has a plugin for istio that will provide valuable transactional/topology data.  The Unified Agent has additional plugins to monitor NGINX traffic, Redis, API Connect, and more.

The Data Collector is sometimes referred to as k8monitor and gets deployed as a pod within the cluster.  By running inside the cluster, it is able to pull in detailed performance KPIs and topology information about the entire cluster.  And, it is able to detect and alert on problems being reported by kubernetes.   As long as it is a recent version of kubernetes, the Data Collector will work to gather data from OCP, ICP, open source kubernetes, and even public cloud kubernetes services such as IKS and GKS.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`The Data Collector needs to be tuned based on the size of the environment being monitored.  The more nodes and pods that are being monitored, the more resources the Kubernetes Data Collector will require.   Rough guideslines are provided in the documentation and you can choose a Size 0 or Size 1 deployment.  Sometimes it is necessary to do further tuning by editing the deployment and giving the data collector more CPU and/or Memory resources.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`The Kubernetes Data Collector can be installed in multiple ways.   In this section, we’ll help you choose the best options based on your environment.  In addition, you’ll notice that there are multiple media options depending on your installation method.  `}</p>\n    <h3>{`Klusterlet with Helm`}</h3>\n    <p>{`The easiest and preferred method is to install the ICAM klusterlet on the managed cluster.  This method  requires that the ICP core services be running in the cluster and that helm is available.   Your MCM cluster will have these services.  For the klusterlet install, you will be using the media labeled as “IBM Cloud App Management V2019.4.0 for Eventing Klusterlet Config…“.  Find the part number that corresponds to the platform where the worker nodes are running (AMD64 for Intel).  The steps to setup the klusterlet with helm can be found here:   `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS8G7U_19.4.0/com.ibm.app.mgmt.doc/content/install_mcm_klusterlet.html\"\n      }}>{`https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS8G7U_19.4.0/com.ibm.app.mgmt.doc/content/install_mcm_klusterlet.html`}</a></p>\n    <p>{`One of the advantages of using the klusterlet is that it is tied into your MCM server.  If anything changes such as the certificates, the Data Collector will continue to function properly because the certs will automatically be updated.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Klusterlet without Helm`}</h3>\n    <p>{`In an MCM environment where help and the ICP core services are not available, the recommended option is to deploy the klusterlet without helm.  These steps are a bit more complicated, but you gain the advantage that certs would be updated automatically.   Use the same Klusterlet media identified in the previous option.  You can find the installation instructions here:  `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS8G7U_19.4.0/com.ibm.app.mgmt.doc/content/install_mcm_klusterlet_no_helm.html\"\n      }}>{`https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS8G7U_19.4.0/com.ibm.app.mgmt.doc/content/install_mcm_klusterlet_no_helm.html`}</a></p>\n    <h3>{`Kubernetes Data Collector Native Installs`}</h3>\n    <p>{`There are additional options for stand-alone ICAM environments or environments where you can’t use the klusterlet.   Normally, you want to use the klusterlet installs, but if you run into trouble you can use the other installation options.   When you do the Kubernetes Data Collector install, you will use different Agent media.  The media will be labeled as “IBM Cloud App Management V2019.4.0 Data Collectors Install” followed by the platform.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`The Kubernetes Data Collector actually has 3 different options for the installation.  Each of the options is listed in priority order starting with the easiest and working down to the most difficult option.   The easiest option is to use the option labeled simply as “Configuring Kubernetes Monitoring”.  This option requires that both helm and ansible be available to perform the install.  If helm and ansible are avialable or the customer is willing to install the, use this option because it is the easiest.  Instructions can be found here:  `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS8G7U_19.4.0/com.ibm.app.mgmt.doc/content/config_cloudresource.html\"\n      }}>{`https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS8G7U_19.4.0/com.ibm.app.mgmt.doc/content/config_cloudresource.html`}</a></p>\n    <p>{`The next option is for customers that have help, but don’t have ansible.

There are definitely considerations as to where to place the PoPs.   Ultimately, your goal is to do 2 things:  `}</p>\n    <ol>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\">\n        <p parentName=\"li\">{`Ensure that the application or service up and running by proactively testing it periodically.  This is particularly important for applications where this is no workload during off-hours.

Choose different network subnets and locations based on where the network gear, load balancers, and HTTP servers are located.`}</p>\n      </li>\n    </ol>\n    <p>{`The most expensive synthetic tests are the scripted selenium based tests.  From a capacity planning perspective, you want to ensure that the PoP can execute the tests.   Synthetic tests with selenium are a little bit heavy weight because they actually launch a Firefox browser to execute the test.  It takes time and processing power to launch Firefox and then execute the website test.  You can run 10 concurrent tests on a single PoP.  If each test takes 10 seconds to execute (including the time to launch Firefox), you can execute approximately 60 tests per minute.  So, pay attention to how many tests are executing and how long they take to execute.  Single web page tests are less taxing.  And, REST API tests are very quick and efficient.  You can many more REST API requests.`}</p>\n    <p>{`To record the web based scripted tests, you download the Selenium IDE.  It is an open source plugin into your browser.

The majority of the Agents are designed for monitoring traditional on-premise resources.  But, there are a few that are designed to monitor cloud workloads such as Office 365, Azure, Amazon EC2, etc.  When installing Agents, all of the Agents get installed into the same directory.  The default directory is /opt/ibm/apm/agent on UNIX/Linux and c:\\\\IBM\\\\APM on Windows.  As described earlier, the first step is to configure your agent media.  After downloading the Agent media from Passport Advantage, process the media with the config pack and use the configured media to do the install.  If you forget to configure the Agent media, the. installer will fail and tell you that the media hasn’t been configured.`}</p>\n    <p>{`There are multiple Agent packages in Passport Advantage.  The core monitoring Agents like WebSphere, Oracle, MQ, OS monitoring, etc. are part of the main Agent media.  You’ll. see Agent package names like “IBM Cloud App Management V2019.4.0 Agents Install xLinux English (CC4KPEN )“.  You’ll notice that there is a unique package for each platform (xLinux, zLinux, pLinux LE, pLinux BE, AIX, Solaris, Windows, etc.).  Download the packages that you need based on the platforms you are trying to monitor.   In addition, you’ll see that there are Extension Packs for some additional specialized monitoring domains.   These Extension Packs are licensed separately.   Specialized domains include SAP HANA, SAP Netweaver, InfoSphere DataStage, Hadoop, etc.   If you can’t find the Agent you are looking for in the main package, look at the Extension Pack to see if you agent is part of the Extension Pack.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The general process is to install the Agent.  Then, some of the monitoring Agents require configuration.  The configuration steps allow the Agent to communicate with and gather data from the Application, middleware, hypervisor, etc.   The OS Agents do not require any configuration steps.  After you install an Agent like the OS Agent that does not require configuration, the Agent will start automatically and will begin gathering performance KPIs.  If the Agent requires configuration settings, then you must configure the Agent and then manually start the Agent before it will gather performance KPIs.   After you configure an Agent, it will be setup to Autostart the next time the server boots, but you must manually start the Agent the first time you want it to run.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The installation process for Agents is pretty straightforward.  You take the configured Agent media and extract the TAR/ZIP file.   CD into the media directory.   Run the installAPMAgents.sh.  The installer will guide you through the processes of installing the Agents.  You can select more  than one  Agent at a time during the  install process.   For example, you would probably install the OS Agent and WebSphere  Agent on  a WebSphere Application Server.`}</p>\n    <p>{`There a some additional options when doing the installs.   The product does support Silent Installs.   This allows you to  automate the deployment of large numbers of Agents.   Steps for performing Silent Installs  can be found here:  `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS8G7U_19.4.0/com.ibm.app.mgmt.doc/content/install_agent_silent.html\"\n      }}>{`https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS8G7U_19.4.0/com.ibm.app.mgmt.doc/content/install_agent_silent.html`}</a></p>\n    <p>{`The installs can be performed as root and non-root.  root installs are simpler to perform.

Usually, it means that the Agent won’t install and run properly.  However, there are cases where it is simply a matter of the prerequisite checks not being updated to keep up with the product releases.   For example, RedHat 8 ships and the prerequisite checker only checks for versions 6.x and 7.x.  It is possible to bypass the prerequisite checker by setting an environment variable prior to runnning the install.`}</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`UNIX/Linux:   export SKIP_PRECHECK=1`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Windows:  set SKIP_PRECHECK=1`}</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h3>{`Agent Configuration`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Once the Agents are installed, many of them require configuration.
