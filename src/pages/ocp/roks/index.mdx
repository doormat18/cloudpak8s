IBM Cloud provides a 
[managed Openshift](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/openshift) offering similar to 
the IBM Kubernetes Service (IKS) offering.  Users can provision a fully 
functional Openshift Cluster in a few clicks. The installation process is 
described [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-getting-started).

The underlying infrastructure is provided by 
[Virtual Server Instances (VSIs)](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/virtual-servers) 
on IBM Cloud Classic Infrastructure (SoftLayer).  The control plane is completely 
managed by IBM while the worker nodes are deployed in the customer's account. 
The worker nodes may be deployed across multiple availability zones for 
additional resiliency.  

As the control plane is managed by IBM, the user only receives access to the 
Openshift API server and not SSH access to any nodes.  This is a good practice 
in general when deploying Cloud Paks to Openshift; that you should not need to 
SSH into any cluster nodes and you will perform Cloud Pak installation from 
another node outside of the cluster.

Note that in ROKS, the internal Openshift image registry is not exposed by 
default (the registry route is not created).  As the registry volume is also 
not sized very large, it is recommended to use 
[IBM Container Registry](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/container-registry) for any 
large image storage such as Cloud Pak image storage.  The internal Openshift 
image registry should mostly be used for S2I and as a local image cache.

Another caveat when using ROKS is that all cluster users must be in IBM Cloud 
IAM.  At this time, Cloud Paks require a cluster-admin user, which means the 
user installing the Cloud Pak must be a super user of the cluster.  See the
[IBM Cloud documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-users) 
on assigning the correct access.  Once the Cloud Pak is installed, a separate 
IAM component manages access to the Cloud Pak services.

Using ROKS on IBM Cloud provides the following infrastructure components:

|Component|Description|
|-|-|
|Load Balancer|Floating IP|
|DNS|IBM Cloud Internet Services (CIS)|
|Certificates (for console and routes)|LetsEncrypt (with automated renewal)|
|Block Storage|IBM Block Storage (SAN)|
|File Storage|IBM File Storage|
|Registry Volume|IBM File Storage - 20GB volume.  Use [IBM Cloud Registry (ICR)](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/container-registry) for large image storage|
|Identity|IBM Cloud IAM|
