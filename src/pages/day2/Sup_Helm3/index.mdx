# Helm 3 for OpenShift
You can find out many technical articles and blogs which talked about Helm on OpenShift. 
Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that helps you more easily package, configure, and deploy applications onto Kubernetes clusters. OpenShift has been providing several deployment methods but Helm surprisingly.

In OpenShift 4.3, Helm 3 for OpenShift Container Platform is introduced as a Technology Preview feature.　Yeah!

There is a bog which talked about this feature. We encourage you to read the blog to understand Helm on OpenShift.
https://blog.openshift.com/openshift-4-3-deploy-applications-with-helm-3/


In this document, we will not exaplin the feature of Helm on Openshift.  Instead, we will demonstrate the feature by following the steps in the OpenShift official document.
Since the official product document does not include the actual commands output (results of commands execution), we will include those for your reference.  Other than those sample output, you can find out most of information in the product official document.

https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/cli_reference/helm_cli/getting-started-with-helm-on-openshift-container-platform.html


## Environment
For this document, we use OpenShift 4.3.5 on Azure (installed via IPI, not ARO).
We will install Helm on our laptop which is MacBook Air. The OS is Mojava (10.14.6).


## Installing Helm on Mac
There are two ways to install the Helm binary onto your laptop.

### Installing Helm via CLI
The official document explains how to install Helm via CLI. For demonstration purposes, we will execute a few more commands than what the officail document said.


1. Uninstall previous version of helm from the laptop
In our case, we unstall the helm 2 command which was installed previously to have a clean environment. If you don't have helm installed, then you can skip this. If you want to keep the previous helm installation, please find out the way to have multiple installations (versions) and make sure that it will work.

Run **which** command to find out if helm command is in the PATH.
```
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:~ kenueno$ which helm
/usr/local/bin/helm
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:~ kenueno$ 
```

In out case, it's in the /usr/local/bin and it's Helm version 2. We ran **helm version** command as below.
```
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:~ kenueno$ helm version
Client: &version.Version{SemVer:"v2.9.1", GitCommit:"20adb27c7c5868466912eebdf6664e7390ebe710", GitTreeState:"clean"}
```

Then, we ran **brew list** command to see if it's installed via **brew** as shown below.
```
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:~ kenueno$ brew list
ansible			bash-completion@2	helm			    libnet			    oniguruma		readline		xz
asdf			certbot			    icu4c			    libtool			    openssl			spruce			yarn
augeas			coreutils		    jmeter			    libunistring		openssl@1.1		sqlite
autoconf		dialog			    jq			        libyaml			    pkg-config		tcptraceroute
automake		dvm			        kubernetes-cli		maven			    postgresql		tree
azure-cli		gdbm			    kubernetes-helm		minikube		    python			unixodbc
bash			gettext			    libidn2			    node			    python@3.8		wget
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:~ kenueno$
```

So, it's installed via brew. Then, ran **brew uninstall** command to delete helm version 2.
```
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:~ kenueno$ brew uninstall helm
Uninstalling /usr/local/Cellar/helm/2.9.1... (50 files, 66.2MB)
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:~ kenueno$ 
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:~ kenueno$ brew uninstall kubernetes-helm
Error: No such keg: /usr/local/Cellar/helm
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:~ kenueno$ 
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:~ kenueno$ brew list
ansible			bash			    gdbm			    libidn2			    minikube		postgresql	    tcptraceroute
asdf			bash-completion@2	gettext			    libnet			    node			python			tree
augeas			certbot			    icu4c			    libtool			    oniguruma		python@3.8		unixodbc
autoconf		coreutils		    jmeter			    libunistring		openssl			readline		wget
automake		dialog			    jq			        libyaml			    openssl@1.1		spruce			xz
azure-cli		dvm			        kubernetes-cli		maven			    pkg-config		sqlite			yarn
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:~ kenueno$
```
As you see above, we ran **brew uninstall helm** command and it deleted both **helm** and **kubernetes-helm** formulas.

Before we install helm 3, make sure that helm 2 is removed from /usr/local/bin and it's not in the PATH as follow.
```
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:~ kenueno$ ls -la /usr/local/bin/helm
ls: /usr/local/bin/helm: No such file or directory
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:~ kenueno$ 
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:~ kenueno$ which helm
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:~ kenueno$
```

2. Download the Helm binary and add it to your path
Now, we will download the Helm 3 binary and put it into **/usr/local/bin** folder.
```
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:~ kenueno$ curl -L https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/helm/latest/helm-darwin-amd64 -o /usr/local/bin/helm
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100 41.4M  100 41.4M    0     0   653k      0  0:01:04  0:01:04 --:--:--  629k
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:~ kenueno$ 
```

Right after you download it to your laptop, it is not executable.
```
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:~ kenueno$ which helm
```

3. Make the binary file executable
Run **chmod** command to make the helm command executable as follow.
```
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:~ kenueno$ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/helm
Password:
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:~ kenueno$ which helm
/usr/local/bin/helm
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:~ kenueno$ 
```
As you see above, the **helm** command is now in the PATH (/usr/local/bin) and excecutable.

4. Check the installed version
Run **helm version** command as follow.
```
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:~ kenueno$ helm version
version.BuildInfo{Version:"v3.1+unreleased", GitCommit:"7ebdbb86fca32c77f2fce166f7f9e58ebf7e9946", GitTreeState:"clean", GoVersion:"go1.13.4"}
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:~ kenueno$ 
```
As of writing this document, the latest version of the helm command from OpenShift site is v3.1 which is newer than what the official document said.


https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/cli_reference/helm_cli/getting-started-with-helm-on-openshift-container-platform.html#on-macos


### Installing Helm via OpenShift Web console
You can also intall the helm binary via OpenShift Web console.

On the right-upper corner on the Web console, there is "?" mark button.　Click that button and you will see the **Command Line Tools** on the pull-down menu.
Click on the **Command Line Tools** then you will see **Command Line Tools** page as shown in below.

![helm1](/assets/img/day2/helm1.png "Pull-down menu")

Click on **Download helm** link as shown in below.

![helm2](/assets/img/day2/helm2.png "Command Line Tools Page")

Then you will got to the external openshift site where you can see the list of helm binary. Select the binary to download as shown in below. In our case, we select **helm-darwin-adm64** for Mac.
![helm3](/assets/img/day2/helm3.png "List of Helm binary")


Now, you have the helm 3 command on your laptop. In the following sections, we will demonstrate two senarios.


## Installing a Helm chart on OpenShift
Let's install your first Helm chart on OpenShift 4.3.5 cluster.

1. Make sure that you have helm 3 installed on your laptop (or where ever you would execute helm command)

2. Make sure that your OpenShift 4.3 cluster is up and running

3. Log in to your OpenShift cluster via CLI
In our case, we use the token instead of the password with **oc login** command as follow.

```
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:~ kenueno$ oc login --token=xdacabababa_fVweYqG3Gisgeasgh4_hpRietebarfZaB --server=https://api.csmoazure1.csmoprivate.tk:6443
The server uses a certificate signed by an unknown authority.
You can bypass the certificate check, but any data you send to the server could be intercepted by others.
Use insecure connections? (y/n): y

Logged into "https://api.csmoazure1.csmoprivate.tk:6443" as "kenueno" using the token provided.

You have access to 54 projects, the list has been suppressed. You can list all projects with 'oc projects'

Using project "default".
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:~ kenueno$ 
```

4. Create a new project
Run **oc new-project** command to create a new project.  In our case, the name of project is "mysql" as shown below.

```
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:~ kenueno$ oc new-project mysql
Now using project "mysql" on server "https://api.csmoazure1.csmoprivate.tk:6443".

You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:

    oc new-app django-psql-example

to build a new example application in Python. Or use kubectl to deploy a simple Kubernetes application:

    kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=gcr.io/hello-minikube-zero-install/hello-node

kenuenonoMacBook-Air:~ kenueno$
```


5. Add a repository of Helm charts to your local Helm client
Run **helm repo add** command and here is the command usage:
> helm repo add [NAME] [URL] [flags]

```
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:~ kenueno$ helm repo add stable https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com/
"stable" has been added to your repositories
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:~ kenueno$ 
```


6. Update the repository
Run **helm repo update** command.
>Update gets the latest information about charts from the respective chart repositories.
>Information is cached locally, where it is used by commands like 'helm search'.

```
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:~ kenueno$ helm repo update
Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories...
...Successfully got an update from the "stable" chart repository
Update Complete. ⎈ Happy Helming!⎈ 
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:~ kenueno$ 
```
Make sure that you see "Happy Helming!" message as shown above.


7. Install an example MySQL chart
Run **helm install** command.  Here is the usage of the command:
>  helm install [NAME] [CHART] [flags]

```
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:~ kenueno$ helm install example-mysql stable/mysql
NAME: example-mysql
LAST DEPLOYED: Wed Mar 18 00:19:38 2020
NAMESPACE: mysql
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
NOTES:
MySQL can be accessed via port 3306 on the following DNS name from within your cluster:
example-mysql.mysql.svc.cluster.local

To get your root password run:

    MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=$(kubectl get secret --namespace mysql example-mysql -o jsonpath="{.data.mysql-root-password}" | base64 --decode; echo)

To connect to your database:

1. Run an Ubuntu pod that you can use as a client:

    kubectl run -i --tty ubuntu --image=ubuntu:16.04 --restart=Never -- bash -il

2. Install the mysql client:

    $ apt-get update && apt-get install mysql-client -y

3. Connect using the mysql cli, then provide your password:
    $ mysql -h example-mysql -p

To connect to your database directly from outside the K8s cluster:
    MYSQL_HOST=127.0.0.1
    MYSQL_PORT=3306

    # Execute the following command to route the connection:
    kubectl port-forward svc/example-mysql 3306

    mysql -h ${MYSQL_HOST} -P${MYSQL_PORT} -u root -p${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:~ kenueno$
```

8. Verify that the chart has installed successfully
Run **helm list** command to verify that the chart "example-mysql" is installed.

>This command lists all of the releases for a specified namespace (uses current namespace context if namespace not specified).

```
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:~ kenueno$ helm list
NAME         	NAMESPACE	REVISION	UPDATED                             	STATUS  	CHART      	APP VERSION
example-mysql	mysql    	1       	2020-03-18 00:19:38.477434 +0900 JST	deployed	mysql-1.6.2	5.7.28     
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:~ kenueno$
```
You should see the chart "example-mysql" in the "mysql" namespace (= project).

9. Verity that the application is running on Web Console
On the OpenShift web console, you can verify that the application you installed via Helm is running.

![helm4](/assets/img/day2/helm4.png "Web Console")

![helm5](/assets/img/day2/helm5.png "Web Console")

![helm6](/assets/img/day2/helm6.png "Web Console")


https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/cli_reference/helm_cli/getting-started-with-helm-on-openshift-container-platform.html#installing-a-helm-chart-on-an-openshift-cluster_getting-started-with-helm-on-openshift


## Creating a custom Helm chart on OpenShift
Now, we will work on the second scenario.

1. Create a new project
We will create another project called "nodejs-ex-k" as follow.

```
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:~ kenueno$ cd RedHat/OpenShift/4.3/azure/
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:azure kenueno$ pwd
/Users/kenueno/RedHat/OpenShift/4.3/azure
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:azure kenueno$ 
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:azure kenueno$ oc new-project nodejs-ex-k
Now using project "nodejs-ex-k" on server "https://api.csmoazure1.csmoprivate.tk:6443".

You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:

    oc new-app django-psql-example

to build a new example application in Python. Or use kubectl to deploy a simple Kubernetes application:

    kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=gcr.io/hello-minikube-zero-install/hello-node

kenuenonoMacBook-Air:azure kenueno$ 
```

2. Download an example Node.js chart that contains OpenShift Container Platform objects
For this scenario, we will download a sample chart from the GitHub as shown below.

```
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:azure kenueno$ git clone https://github.com/redhat-developer/redhat-helm-charts
Cloning into 'redhat-helm-charts'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 61, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (61/61), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (45/45), done.
remote: Total 61 (delta 22), reused 42 (delta 11), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (61/61), done.
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:azure kenueno$
```


3. Go to the directory with the sample chart
Once you clone the git repo, move to the directory as shown below.

```
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:azure kenueno$ cd redhat-helm-charts/alpha/nodejs-ex-k/
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:nodejs-ex-k kenueno$ 
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:nodejs-ex-k kenueno$ pwd
/Users/kenueno/RedHat/OpenShift/4.3/azure/redhat-helm-charts/alpha/nodejs-ex-k
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:nodejs-ex-k kenueno$
```
Make sure that you are in the nodejs-ex-k directory.


4. Edit the Chart.yaml file and add a description of your chart

Before we edit the Chart.yaml file, we make a copy and save it as Cart.yaml.org as follow. It's not necessary step but it would be a good practice.
```
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:nodejs-ex-k kenueno$ ls -la Chart.yaml
-rw-r--r--  1 kenueno  staff  909 Mar 18 00:22 Chart.yaml
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:nodejs-ex-k kenueno$ 
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:nodejs-ex-k kenueno$ cp -p Chart.yaml Chart.yaml.org
```

Then we take a look at the Chart.yaml file.
```
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:nodejs-ex-k kenueno$ cat Chart.yaml
apiVersion: v2
name: nodejs-ex-k
description: A Helm chart for Kubernetes

# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
#
# Application charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged into versioned archives
# to be deployed.
#
# Library charts provide useful utilities or functions for the chart developer. They're included as
# a dependency of application charts to inject those utilities and functions into the rendering
# pipeline. Library charts do not define any templates and therefore cannot be deployed.
type: application

# This is the chart version. This version number should be incremented each time you make changes
# to the chart and its templates, including the app version.
version: 0.1.0

# This is the version number of the application being deployed. This version number should be
# incremented each time you make changes to the application.
appVersion: 1.16.0
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:nodejs-ex-k kenueno$ 
```

As the official document said, we will add the following four key and value pairs:
- The chart API version. It should be v2 for Helm charts that require at least Helm 3.
- The name of your chart.
- The description of your chart.
- The URL to an image to be used as an icon.

Here is what the official document said.
```
apiVersion: v2 
name: nodejs-ex-k 
description: A Helm chart for OpenShift 
icon: https://static.redhat.com/libs/redhat/brand-assets/latest/corp/logo.svg
```

Here is how our Chart.yaml looks like.
```
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:nodejs-ex-k kenueno$ vi Chart.yaml
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:nodejs-ex-k kenueno$ cat Chart.yaml
apiVersion: v2
name: nodejs-ex-k
description: A Helm chart for OpenShift 
icon: https://static.redhat.com/libs/redhat/brand-assets/latest/corp/logo.svg

# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
#
# Application charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged into versioned archives
# to be deployed.
#
# Library charts provide useful utilities or functions for the chart developer. They're included as
# a dependency of application charts to inject those utilities and functions into the rendering
# pipeline. Library charts do not define any templates and therefore cannot be deployed.
# type: application

# This is the chart version. This version number should be incremented each time you make changes
# to the chart and its templates, including the app version.
# version: 0.1.0

# This is the version number of the application being deployed. This version number should be
# incremented each time you make changes to the application.
# appVersion: 1.16.0
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:nodejs-ex-k kenueno$ 
```
As the OpenShift document said, we have 4 key and value paris and commented out rest of lines are commented out as shown above.


5. Verify that the chart is formatted properly
Run **helm lint** command to very that the chart (Chart.yaml) you created is formatted properly.

>This command takes a path to a chart and runs a series of tests to verify that the chart is well-formed.
>If the linter encounters things that will cause the chart to fail installation, it will emit [ERROR] messages. If it encounters issues that break with convention or recommendation, it will emit [WARNING] messages.

```
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:nodejs-ex-k kenueno$ helm lint
==> Linting .
[ERROR] Chart.yaml: version is required
[ERROR] templates/: validation: chart.metadata.version is required

Error: 1 chart(s) linted, 1 chart(s) failed
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:nodejs-ex-k kenueno$ 
```

Sigh...  We failed with an error message. It said "version is required".  Oh no... We commented out the line "version: 0.1.0" in the Chart.yaml file since the OpenShift document didn't mention it.

We need to add (comment out, in fact) the version in the Chart.yaml file as follow.

```
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:nodejs-ex-k kenueno$ vi Chart.yaml
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:nodejs-ex-k kenueno$ cat Chart.yaml
apiVersion: v2
name: nodejs-ex-k
description: A Helm chart for OpenShift 
icon: https://static.redhat.com/libs/redhat/brand-assets/latest/corp/logo.svg

# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
#
# Application charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged into versioned archives
# to be deployed.
#
# Library charts provide useful utilities or functions for the chart developer. They're included as
# a dependency of application charts to inject those utilities and functions into the rendering
# pipeline. Library charts do not define any templates and therefore cannot be deployed.
# type: application

# This is the chart version. This version number should be incremented each time you make changes
# to the chart and its templates, including the app version.
version: 0.1.0

# This is the version number of the application being deployed. This version number should be
# incremented each time you make changes to the application.
# appVersion: 1.16.0
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:nodejs-ex-k kenueno$ 
```

Try again. It should work. Run **helm lint** command as follow.
```
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:nodejs-ex-k kenueno$ helm lint
==> Linting .

1 chart(s) linted, 0 chart(s) failed
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:nodejs-ex-k kenueno$ 
```
Now it works. Yes!!  We need to make sure that the **version** in the chart.

6. Install the chart
We will install the chart. Move (change directory) to the parent directory (alpha directory).
```
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:nodejs-ex-k kenueno$ cd ..
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:alpha kenueno$ pwd
/Users/kenueno/RedHat/OpenShift/4.3/azure/redhat-helm-charts/alpha
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:alpha kenueno$ 
```

Run **helm install** command.  Here is the usage of the command:
>  helm install [NAME] [CHART] [flags]

```
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:alpha kenueno$ helm install nodejs-chart nodejs-ex-k
NAME: nodejs-chart
LAST DEPLOYED: Wed Mar 18 00:31:24 2020
NAMESPACE: nodejs-ex-k
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:alpha kenueno$ 
```

7. Verify that the chart has installed successfully
Run **helm list** command as follow.
```
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:alpha kenueno$ helm list
NAME        	NAMESPACE  	REVISION	UPDATED                             	STATUS  	CHART            	APP VERSION
nodejs-chart	nodejs-ex-k	1       	2020-03-18 00:31:24.217591 +0900 JST	deployed	nodejs-ex-k-0.1.0	           
kenuenonoMacBook-Air:alpha kenueno$ 
```
Make sure that there is **nodejs-chart** helm chart is displayed.


8. Verity that the application is running on Web Console
On the OpenShift web console, you can verify that the application you installed via Helm is running.
