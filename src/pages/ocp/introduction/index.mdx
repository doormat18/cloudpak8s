Openshift 4 is the base platform for all Cloud Paks described on this site. 
Installing it in a consistent 
way in both on-premises and the public cloud provides a stable landing ground 
for Cloud Pak deployment.  This section discusses the  installation of Openshift 4
on various cloud infrastructures and introduces the concepts around the 
Terraform automation tool. On this site, every reference to OpenShift, unless
otherwise specified, will assume OpenShift 4.

As of this page update, the latest generally available version was OpenShift 4.3.
OpenShift 4 is a major advance over OpenShift 3, and contains a number of 
significant architectural changes. The official Red Hat OpenShift documentation
includes a 
[product architecture overview](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/architecture/architecture.html)
that describes the structure and functions of OpenShift 4. 

OpenShift provides a consistent application environment on a variety of 
infrastructure platforms. These platforms include public cloud providers, such
as [Amazon Web Services](../openshift4_aws/) (AWS), 
[Microsoft Azure](../openshift4_azure/), 
[Google Cloud Platform](../openshift4_gcp/) (GCP), and
[IBM's managed Red Hat OpenShift service](../roks/) (ROKS).
They also include platforms traditionally thought of as on premise, such as 
[VMware](../openshift4_vmware/), OpenStack, and bare metal. Wherever it is 
installed, it provides a 
consistent container application runtime, APIs, and interfaces.

Since the focus of this site is on installing OpenShift 4 and the IBM Cloud Paks,
installation is where we will focus.

### **OpenShift Installation Overview**

One of the major advances in OpenShift 4 is the 
[installation process](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/architecture/architecture-installation.html). 
There are 
two types of installation available:
- Installer-provisioned infrastructure (IPI), where the installation program also 
provisions all the infrstructure (machines, networks, storage, etc) required 
for the cluster.
- User-provisioned infrastructure (UPI), where the installation program installs
the cluster on infrastructure that has previously been set up by the user.

The default installation type is installer-provisioned infrastructure, which is 
recommended wherever possible. Using this method, the installation program works
as a wizard, prompting you for configuration values that it cannot determine
by itself. You are able to install either a standard cluster with preset starndard
sizes and configurations, or you have the option of specifying more customized
parameters. With IPI, OpenShift itself manages all aspects of the cluster, 
including the operating systems of the nodes. Again, the IPI method is recommended
wherever possible.

User-provisioned infrastructure installation can be used in special circumstances
requiring more customized infrastructure requirements. One of these requirements
is a network restricted or "air-gapped" installation, where the cluster to be 
installed is not allowed to have internet access. In this case, the installation
images can be staged on an internal network, and UPI installation can be used. 
If UPI installation is used because of client requirements, tools 
such as [terraform](../terraform/) can be used to to automate the setup of the
user-provisioned infrastructure, and the installtion of OpenShift itself. This
web site provides links to example terraform configurations for most of the 
infrastructure platforms described.
