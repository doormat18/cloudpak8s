## Prerequisites

Before beginning these steps you should have:
1. A github account (or Github Enterprise)
1. A Dockerhub account (needed to install docker)
1. A Red Hat entitled customer account (to install oc)
1. An IDE (Eclipse or VS Code to use with Codewind)
1. A login for your Openshift Container cluster


## Installing Client tools from web pages on the cluster

Two web pages will be created, as part of installing the OpenShift Container Platform cluster and the Cloud Pak for Applications. 
The two landing pages can be found in the Cluster Console under Routes and are named kabanero-landing and icpa-landing.
It is recommended that you use these pages to get the most current installation information about the client tools. 
This document will also provide links to these tools on the web.

When the OpenShift cluster is created, a reference page is generated for the OpenShift command line tools. There are several useful links on this page. Get this URL from your administrator.

**Note:** You will need to authenticate (login) to your cluster.

When the Cloud Pak for Applications is installed, a "landing page" is created for the Kabanero Enterprise edition. Your administrator can give you this URL.

**Note:** You will need to authenticate (login) to your cluster.
