## Configuring Your Installation

The installation of the Cloud Pak is configured via the 
settings in your **config.yaml**.  As part of either the 
**online** or **offline** or air-gap install, this file will 
be made available to you via the installation package.

Below is an example of the **config.yaml** extracted from 
the inception image.

```yaml

# Nodes selected to run common services components.
#
# The value of the master, proxy, and management parameters is an array,
# by providing multiple nodes the common services will be configured in
# a high availability configuration.
#
# It is recommended to install the components onto one or more openshift
# worker nodes. The master, proxy, and management components can all share
# the same node or set of nodes.
cluster_nodes:
  master:
    - <your-openshift-dedicated-node-to-deploy-master-components>
  proxy:
    - <your-openshift-dedicated-node-to-deploy-proxy-components>
  management:
    - <your-openshift-dedicated-node-to-deploy-management-components>

# Storage Class
storage_class: <storage class available in OpenShift>

## You can set different storage class for logging.
## By default it will use the value of storage_class.
# elasticsearch_storage_class:

## If you are installing on ROKS environment please update following settings
## roks_enabled: set this to true
## roks_url: Openshift public service endpoint URL
## roks_user_prefix: User prefix used for users enabled on ROKS, Default value is 'IAM#'.
## You can get users information from command 'oc get users'.

# default_admin_password:
# password_rules:

## You can disable following services if they are not needed

# This section installs the IBM Cloud Pak for Integration Platform Navigator.
# The navigator will be available after installation at:
# https://ibm-icp4i-prod-integration.some-openshift-apps-domain/
archive_addons:
  icp4i:
    namespace: integration
    repo: local-charts

```


Each section is described below.

**cluster_nodes** - This section describes which nodes in your cluster used to run Common Services. These components are split into three sections master, proxy and management. The number of nodes you specify in each section determines the number of nodes that the work can be split across and will determine the potential level resiliency.  The most common best-practice approach to to specify the same three nodes for each of these.  The values supplied should be chosen from the context of the results of `oc get nodes`.  You must include master nodes in this list but you **do not include your OCP master nodes**.

**storage_class** - The storage class is the dynamic storage class that the installer will use when creating persistent volumes. The Cloud Pak for Integration base installation requires a `block` storage provider. Use `oc get sc` to view your available storage classes.

**default_admin_password** - The default_admin_password is the password that will be assigned the default `admin` user to authenticate to the Cloud Pak for Integration Navigator. Match the password format requirements for your organization.  The below stanza provides a very open policy.  Specify the default password for the `admin` user.

```yaml
default_admin_password: your_password_here
password_rules:
- '(.*)'
```

**management_services** - The management_service section allows you to enable or disable some the Common Services. The default values are generally sufficient.  Additional services may require additional capacity.


## Offline Installation

![Offline Install Process](offline-install-flow.png)

This installation requires that you have downloaded the 
**offline** installation package and it is available from 
your installation server that has both Docker and the Open 
Container CLI installed.

**1.** From your installation server command line authenticate 
to the OpenShift Cloud Platform (OCP) cluster where you would 
like to install the Cloud Pak (the connection token can be 
copied from the OpenShift Console UI)

```bash
oc login --token=your_token_here --server=your_server_URL_here
```

**2.** Create a working directory and move the PPA archive 
package into that directory.

```bash
mkdir ibm-cp-int
mv ibm-cp-int-2020.1.1-offline.tgz ibm-cp-int/ibm-cp-int-2020.1.1-offline.tgz
cd ibm-cp-int
```

**3.** Extract the package and load the archive ( this may 
take ~10-20 minutes)

```
tar xvf ibm-cp-int-2020.1.1-offline.tgz
tar xf installer_files/cluster/images/common-services-boeblingen-x86_64.tar.gz -O | docker load
```

**4.** Change to the cluster directory and create the 
kubeconfig file that the installation will use to connect to 
your OCP cluster.

```bash
cd installer_files/cluster
oc config view --minify=true --flatten=true > kubeconfig
```

**5.** Edit the **config.yaml** and update the **cluster_node** section adding the names of your cluster compute / worker nodes to deploy the Common Services to. Remember, the best-practice is to use the same three nodes for each master, proxy and management.  Use the exact node names from the `oc get nodes` command.

**6.** Add the storage class for your cluster in the **storage_class** field. The storage class must be a block storage provider. Use the exact node names from the `oc get sc` command.

**7.** Update the **default_admin_password** field with a suitable password

**8.** Define the **management_services**  appropriate to your install.  (The default is sufficient for many deployments.)

**9.** Start the installation (this can run for ~30-45min).  The below command adds verbose logging and streams the results to an output file that can be referenced later.

```
sudo docker run -t --net=host -e LICENSE=accept -v $(pwd):/installer/cluster:z -v /var/run:/var/run:z -v /etc/docker:/etc/docker:z --security-opt label:disable cp.icr.io/cp/icp-foundation/icp-inception:3.2.4 addon -vvv | tee output.txt
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** The command above will fail if you have spaces in your directory path. Run `pwd` to verify your path and remove spaces, then re-run installation command.

</InlineNotification>

**10.** Connect to the IBM Cloud Pak for Integration UI to verify the installation. Use the `oc get routes -A | grep integration` command to find the URL.  The URL will take a form similar to the following ibm-icp4i-prod-integration.apps.your-cluster-domain.com

## Online Installation

![Online Install Process](online-install-flow.png)

This installation requires that you have downloaded the **online** installation package and it is available from your installation server (this may be your laptop) that has both Docker and the Open Container CLI installed.

**1.** Log in to [MyIBM Container Software Library](https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary) with the IBMid and password that are associated with the entitled software.  In the Entitlement Keys section, copy the entitlement key. This key will be used in future steps.

**2.** From your installation server command line authenticate to the OpenShift Cloud Platform (OCP) cluster where you would like to install the Cloud Pak (the connection token can be copied from the OpenShift Console UI)

```bash
oc login --token=your_token_here --server=your_server_URL_here
```

**3.** Verify that you are able to login to the public docker repo using your entitlement key.  With some Cloud Pak installations (non-Integration), you would pull your inception image from this registry.  For Integration you downloaded that image from PPA.  This step simply verifies your entitlement key from above is valid.

   ```bash
docker login cp.icr.io --username cp --password <your entitlement key>
   ```

**4.** Create a working directory and move the PPA archive (online installation) package into that directory.

```bash
mkdir ibm-cp-int
mv ibm-cp-int-2020.1.1-online.tgz ibm-cp-int/ibm-cp-int-2020.1.1-online.tgz
cd ibm-cp-int
```

**5.** Extract the package and load the archive with Docker

```bash
tar xvf ibm-cp-int-2020.1.1-online.tgz
sudo docker load -i installer_files/cluster/images/icp-inception-3.2.4.tgz
```

**4.** Change to the cluster directory and create the kubeconfig file that the installation will use to connect to your OCP cluster

```bash
cd installer_files/cluster
oc config view --minify=true --flatten=true > kubeconfig
```

**5.** Edit the **config.yaml** and update the **cluster_node** section adding the names of your cluster compute / worker nodes to deploy the Common Services to. Remember, the best-practice is to use the same three nodes for each master, proxy and management.  Use the exact node names from the `oc get nodes` command.

**6.** Continue in the **config.yaml** and add the storage class for your cluster in the **storage_class** field. The storage class must be a block storage provider. Use the exact node names from the `oc get sc` command.

**7.** Continue in the **config.yaml** and update the **default_admin_password** field with a suitable password

**8.** Also in the **config.yaml** include the required cloud and IBM entitled registry settings
